# The Minecraft Chuunibyou Mod

This is a project I started a while back, coding in Java and honestly doing everything wrong. So, since I still really like the idea, I'm now starting again in Scala, with a much better head on my shoulders (at least I hope) and much better motivation to actually continue the project.

## Roadmap/TODO

- [x] Mana System
- [x] Level System
- [x] Tyrant's Eye Weapon/Armor Set
- [ ] The Priestess Set
- [ ] Dark Flame Master Set
- [ ] Mjolnir Hammer Set
- [ ] Mori Summer Set
- [ ] Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII Set
- [ ] Angel of Sleep Set
- [ ] Properly balance sets
- [ ] Lots of random/cute little references
- [ ] 3D weapon models
- [ ] and more...
