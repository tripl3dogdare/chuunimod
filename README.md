# The Minecraft Chuunibyou Mod

This is a project I started a while back, coding in Java and honestly doing everything wrong. So, since I still really like the idea, I'm now starting again in Scala, with a much better head on my shoulders (at least I hope) and much better motivation to actually continue the project.

## Roadmap/TODO

- [x] Mana System
- [x] Level System
- [x] Tyrant's Eye Weapon/Armor Set
- [ ] The Priestess Set
- [ ] Dark Flame Master Set
- [ ] Mjolnir Hammer Set
- [ ] Mori Summer Set
- [ ] Sophia Ring SP Saturn VII Set
- [ ] Angel of Dreams Set
- [ ] Properly balance sets
- [ ] Lots of random/cute little references
- [ ] 3D weapon models
- [ ] and more...

If you'd like to see somewhat of where the mod is going, you can take a look at the [progress updates for the previous attempt](http://imgur.com/a/uIeAe). That link will take you to the first one, and you can navigate using the in-post links from there.

## A Quick Note

This mod is made entirely in homage to the show that it's content comes from. I intend no copyright infringement, and throw my full support behind the show and it's creators in the creation of this mod.

I have also taken the liberty of naming some things that were never given proper names in the show (such as the Angel of Dreams set for Kumin's gear, as she was never given an official Chuuni name). I am doing my best to stay true to the feel of the existing names in the show, but please feel free to let me know if you have an idea for a better name.

Thanks!
