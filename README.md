# The Minecraft Chuunibyou Mod

This is a project I started a while back, coding in Java and honestly doing everything wrong. So, since I still really like the idea, I'm now starting again in Scala, with a much better head on my shoulders (at least I hope) and much better motivation to actually continue the project.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add a bunch of Chuunibyou related stuff
- [ ] Have it be awesome
- [ ] Don't actually be a n00b and drop the project again
